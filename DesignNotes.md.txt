Cell: nullable count of adjacent edges that are part of path, 0-4, linked to four junctions and four edges
Junction: links 2-4 edges, 1-4 squares
Edge: nullable bool, part of path or not. Liked to two junctions and two cells.

Path: linked list of edges, partial or complete

_ or | = edge is part of path
× = edge is not part of path
. = undetermined
N = number of adjacent edges
U = unknown number placeholder 


Generator: randomly draw line until a full loop is made using most of the space. Then fill in all the numbers. Then back solve from the numbers, removing one randomly at a time until nothing can be removed without creating ambiguity.

Streamlined solver:
- List of junctions to vist
- List of cells to visit
- Hash
